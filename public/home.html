			What is happiness? We can ask hundreds of people, and each of them would probably give different answers. 
			One would say that happiness is to be with a loved one, the second would say that happiness is the stability, and the third, on the contrary, 
			would say that happiness is the unpredictability. For someone, to be happy is to have a lot of money while for others – to be popular. 
			All in all, there are plenty of different understandings of happiness.
			Personally, I consider happiness as simplicity and peace when my family and friends are healthy and happy as well. I recognize that they all are dear to me and able to understand what is going on inside me. I know that they will support me in any situation doing everything that depends on them. In return, I am also ready to do much for them. What we do for others, helping them when they need our help, advice, or support and obtaining appreciation, is happiness because helping others, we are doing something very significant and necessary.
			What does it mean to be happy? I think it is, primarily, a state of mind, it means to have harmony with yourself and the people around. 
			Happiness is multi-faceted. Perhaps, the word “love” is the most appropriate one to describe my happiness as love is driven by our world. 
			People create wonderful things concerning their job, hobby, or family. Love is life, and I am happy when I realize that I live up to the hilt.
			However, some people might be unhappy even though they should be. For example, teenagers who have everything to live a happy life, 
			including healthy family, close friends, and enough money to satisfy basic needs, ask their parents to buy the latest model of IPhone. 
			In the case, parents could not afford it, some teenagers tend to feel unhappy. After all, one can be a successful leader and have millions as well as prestige, 
			but do not have a loving family and emotional harmony.
			In my opinion, material values are not a true measure of happiness. Happiness is the ability to be optimistic in spite of difficulties and the ability 
			to overcome them successfully. Finally, challenges should be taken as the lessons that life presents us. Even the negative things teach something, 
			give a new experience, or refer to the correct direction.
			I believe that happiness is not a gift and not a given right as every person has its own happiness inside. Moreover, it is never too late to become happy. 
			We can inspire and motivate ourselves and others to be happy. A stranger’s passing smile, warm rays of the sun penetrating the window, 
			or a cup of freshly brewed coffee – happiness is in detail. Everyone chooses and prefers different sources. It is of great importance for people to enjoy 
			moments of life, even the most insignificant ones.
			We need to appreciate every moment in our lives remembering that happiness is within us. After all, 
			time passes, and we are getting hurt by the fact that we did not appreciate the time when we had a chance. 
			Therefore, living in peace and harmony with others, helping those who need your help, and avoiding things that you would regret 
			about in future are paramount ways to find happiness and make others happy.
